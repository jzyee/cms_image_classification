## What is the smallest particle in the world?
As we learned in high school physics and chemistry class, an atom is the smallest constituent unit of ordinary matter that constitutes a chemical element. An atom is composed of two regions: the **nucleus**, which is in the center of the atom and contains **protons** and **neutrons**, and the outer region of the atom, which holds its **electrons** in orbit around the nucleus.

It seems the three particles **protons**, **neutrons** and **electrons** make up the whole universe. However, protons and neutrons are only two particles in a large family called **hadrons**. Unlike the electron, hadrons are not fundamental - they are made up of even smaller particles called **quarks**.

A quark is a **fundamental particle** which means it can not be made by other particles and we also call these particles as **elementary particles**. **Quarks** make up one of family of elementary particles, while the other is **leptons**, which is electron’s family. Quarks and leptons consist of **Elementary Fermions**, while the other type called **Elementary Bosons**.

## LHC & CMS?
- particle accelerator
A **particle accelerator** is a machine that uses electromagnetic fields to propel charged particles to very high speeds and energies. Typically, we accelerate a stream of particles which called **beam** to near the speed of light.

- particle collision
Inside the accelerator, two **high-energy particle beams** travel at close to the speed of light before they are made to collide. After collision new particles are generated.

- LHC
The most powerful accelerator currently is the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) near Geneva, Switzerland, built by the European collaboration **CERN** (European Organization for Nuclear Research)
- CMS 
The Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) is a detector at LHC to detect the process of the particle collision and record the result. Then scientists collect these data together and put them online (**CMS Open Data portal**) for public to use them on further experiments.

## Machine Learning & Deep Learning 
- Machine Learning
Machine learning is the science of teaching machines how to learn by themselves. We provide data for the machine and make it learn the information from these data. Then, the Machines can make decision by themselves.

- Deep Learning
Deep learning is one of the Machine learning methods which applies more sophisticated algorithms to solve complex problems.

## Experiment
The amount of data for particle collision is very huge, which is the basic condition to use machine leaning. In our experiment, we extract the collision data from CERN’s website. Then convert the data into images which can be easily analyzed by deep learning model.
