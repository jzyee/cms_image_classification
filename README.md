## General Info
This project is based of this paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.07034.pdf
The program of LHC and CMS records the collision of high energy physics and shares the data in the worldwide LHC Computing Grid, which gives a platform for physicists in 42 countries. 
With CMS open data, this research applied convolutional neural network to classify ttbar jets, W jets and Drell-Yan jets. We compare the performance of five well-known convolutional neural network and test transfer learning in particle classification.
